# PHoenix - A PHP static analysis tool.
Project on Web Vulnerabilities for the Software Security Course at IST Alameda 17/18.

A PHP static analysis tool done with very limited time constraints that actually turned out to be good. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

As for the onomastic, this project was raised from its predecessor's ashes, hence the name.

Developed, tried and tested on Python 3.6.3.
